- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- To optimize searching, we should keep BST balanced when we add or remove node.
- A tree is balanced if:
    - The left subtree height and the right subtree height differ by at most 1.
    - Visit every node making sure the rule above is satisfied.

> Note: Height of a node is the distance (edge count) from the farthest child to itself.
